    <P>MRS. ALVING. Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.<Br>
        <Br>
        MANDERS. I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
        morsel of dinner.<Br>
        <Br>
        MRS. ALVING. [Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.] Nor I.
        But what is to be done now?<Br>
        <Br>
        MANDERS. Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
        utterly without experience in matters of this sort.<Br>
        <Br>
        MRS. ALVING. I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.<Br>
        <Br>
        MANDERS. No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
        nevertheless.<Br>
        <Br>
        MRS. ALVING. It is only an idle fancy on Oswald's part; you may be sure
        of that.<Br></P>
