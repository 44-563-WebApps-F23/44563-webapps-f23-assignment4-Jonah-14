    <b><h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6></b><p>Not when the door is shut. Besides, he's just going out.</p>
        <b><h6>MANDERS.</h6></b><p>I am still quite upset. I don't know how I could swallow a
        morsel of dinner.</p>
        <b><h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6></b><p><span style="color:red;">[Controlling her nervousness, walks up and down.]</span> Nor I.
        But what is to be done now?</p>       
        <b><h6>MANDERS.</h6></b><p>Yes; what is to be done? I am really quite at a loss. I am so
        utterly without experience in matters of this sort.</p>        
        <b><h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6></b><p>I feel sure that, so far, no mischief has been done.</p>        
        <b><h6>MANDERS.</h6></b><p>No; heaven forbid! But it is an unseemly state of things,
        nevertheless.</p>       
        <b><h6>MRS. ALVING.</h6></b><p>It is only an idle fancy on Oswald's part; you may be sure
        of that.</p>
