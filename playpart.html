    <p>NURSE.<br>
        What, out again? In this horrible weather? You will catch cold, ma’am,
        and make yourself ill.<br>
        <br>
        NORA.<br>
        Well, worse than that might happen. How are the children?<br>
        <br>
        NURSE.<br>
        The poor little souls are playing with their Christmas presents, but—<br>
        <br>
        NORA.<br>
        Do they ask much for me?<br>
        <br>
        NURSE.<br>
        You see, they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them.<br>
        <br>
        NORA.<br>
        Yes, but, nurse, I shall not be able to be so much with them now as I
        was before.<br>
        <br>
        NURSE.<br>
        Oh well, young children easily get accustomed to anything.<br></p>
